I wanted to have a photobooth at my wedding. It was too expensive with a tight budget, so I made my own.
It is very basic and quite insecure at the moment. Though it is a good start!

This is a Rails based backend to service an AIR based photobooth Desktop application.

TODO:
  add authentication/authorization
  add mobile submission capability
  add photo delivery/sharability
  fix AIR app camera aspect ratio to and from fullscreen
